[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/dog-vision.ipynb)

## Project Overview
Dog Vision is a deep learning project that identifies dog breeds from images using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project demonstrates the application of TensorFlow and Keras in building a highly accurate image classification model, while also highlighting best practices in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved strong performance on dog breed classification using transfer learning.
- **Data Handling:** Efficient image preprocessing, resizing, and augmentation to improve model generalization.
- **Visualization:** Insightful visualizations of training metrics, accuracy, and prediction results.
- **Deployment Ready:** The model and notebook are structured for easy extension to web or mobile applications.
- **Colab Ready**: Fully compatible with Google Colab for GPU acceleration.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of different dog breeds. Images were preprocessed and augmented for robust training.

## Installation
1. Open the project in Google Colab using the badge above.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-vision.git
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   !pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy on the validation set.

- Successfully classifies multiple dog breeds in real-time predictions.

## Future Work

* Deploy the model as a web or mobile application.

* Expand dataset to include more breeds.

* Integrate with Gradio or Streamlit for an interactive demo.
